Configuration File Overview
===========================

There is a single configuration file for each Intel\ :sup:`®` QAT Endpoint and there may be multiple Intel\ :sup:`®` QAT Endpoints.

.. note::

    Depending on the model number, a device may also contain no  Intel\ :sup:`®` QAT Endpoints.

The configuration file is split into a number of different sections: a General section and one or more Logical Instance sections.

The *General* section includes parameters that allow the user to specify:

-  Which services are enabled.
-  Concurrent requests default configuration.
-  Interrupt coalescing configuration (optional).
-  Statistics gathering configuration.

Additional details are included in :ref:`General Section <qat_2.0_pg_configuration_files_general-section>`.

*Logical Instances* sections (there may be one or more) include parameters that allow the user to set:

-  The number of cryptography or data compression instances being managed.
-  For each instance, the name of the instance, whether or not polling is enabled, and the core to which an instance is affinitized.

Additional details are included in :ref:`Logical Instances Section <qat_2.0_pg_configuration_files_logical-instances-section>`.

Sample configuration files are included in the package in the ``quickassist/utilities/adf_ctl/conf_files`` directory.
