Environmental Assumptions
=========================

The following assumptions are made about the deployment environment:

   -  The driver object/executable file on disk should be protected using
      the normal file protection mechanisms, so it is writable by only
      trusted users, for example, a privileged user or an administrator.

   -  The public key firmware image on the disk should be protected using
      normal file protection mechanisms, so it is writable only by trusted
      users, for example, a privileged user or an administrator.

   -  The Intel\ :sup:`®` QAT device should not be exposed (via Single-root
      Input/Output Virtualization (SRIOV)) to untrusted guests.

   -  The Intel\ :sup:`®` QAT device should not be exposed (through the
      *user space direct* deployment model) to untrusted users.

   -  The Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) is considered to be inside
      the trust boundary. The traditional memory-protection schemes
      provided by the Intel\ :sup:`®` architecture processor and memory
      controller, and by the OS, is to prevent unauthorized access to these
      memory regions.

   -  Persistent keys were not considered, but the storage media are also
      considered inside the cryptographic boundary.

   -  The driver exposed device file should be protected using the normal
      file protection mechanisms so that it could be opened and
      read/written only by trusted users.
