<p>This section describes the potential threats identified as part of the secure architecture analysis of the Intel<sup>®</sup> Quick Assist Technology
acceleration complex and the actions that can be taken to protect against these threats.
This chapter concentrates on the acceleration complex. First, the terminology covering the main threat categories and mechanisms, attacker privilege
and deployment models are presented. Then, some common mitigation actions that can be applied to many of these threat categories and mechanisms are
discussed. Finally, more specific threat/attack vectors, including attacks against specific services of the PCH device are described.</p>

<h2>Threat/Attack Vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#threat-attack-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>A thorough analysis has been conducted by considering each of the threat
categories, attack mechanisms, attacker privilege levels, and deployment
models. As a result, the following threats have been identified. Also
described are the steps a user of the PCH chipset can take to mitigate
against each threat. Some general practices that mitigate many of the
common threats are considered first. Thereafter, threats on specific
services and mitigation against those threats are described.</p>
<section id="general-mitigation">
<h3>General Mitigation<a class="headerlink" href="#general-mitigation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The following mitigation techniques are generic to different threats and attack vectors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ensure that all software running on the platform that has access to Intel<sup>®</sup> Quick Assist Technology devices is within the trust boundary of the platform owner. This mitigation includes software running in virtual machines and containers.</p></li>
<li><p>Intel<sup>®</sup> follows Secure Coding guidelines, including performing code reviews and running static analysis on its driver software and firmware, to ensure its compliance with security guidelines. It is recommended that customers follow similar guidelines when developing application code. This should include the use of tools such as static analysis, fuzzing, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure each hardware component, including the PCH chipset, processor, and DRAM, is physically secured from attackers. This can include such examples as physical locks, tamper proofing, and Faraday cages (to prevent side-channel attacks via electromagnetic radiation).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that network services not required on the module are not operating and that the corresponding network ports are locked down.</p></li>
<li><p>Use strong passwords to protect against dictionary and other attacks on administrative and other login accounts.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="general-threats">
<h3>General Threats<a class="headerlink" href="#general-threats" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>General threats include the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#security-dma"><span class="std std-ref">DMA</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#security-ia-driver"><span class="std std-ref">Intentional Modification of IA Driver</span></a></p></li>

</ul>
<section id="dma">
<span id="security-dma"></span><h4>DMA<a class="headerlink" href="#dma" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Threat:</strong> The PCH can perform Direct Memory Access (DMA, the copying
of data) between defined memory locations. Once an attacker has
sufficient privilege to invoke the Intel<sup>®</sup> QuickAssist
Technology API, or to write to/read from the hardware rings used by the
driver to communicate with the device, they can send requests to the
Intel<sup>®</sup> QuickAssist Accelerator to perform such DMA, passing
arbitrary physical memory addresses as the source and/or destination
addresses, thereby exposing or modifying regions of memory to which they
would otherwise not have access.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation 1:</strong>  Ensure that Intel<sup>®</sup> Input-Output Memory Management Unit
(IOMMU) is enabled. This will force USDM to create QuickAssist IOMMU domain and
all memory allocated by USDM will be mapped into this domain, hence malicious
user or error in user application cannot read or write memory outside this domain
which mitigates the risk.  However because there is only single domain, there is
no protection between individual Virtual Functions(VFs) or applications.  This design
is done for simplicity of memory manager and if needed, VFIO-PCI should be used
to create individual domains per VF.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation 2:</strong> Ensure that only trusted users are granted permissions
to access the Intel<sup>®</sup> QuickAssist Technology API, or to write to
and read from the hardware rings. Specifically, the PCH configuration
file describes logical instances of acceleration services and the set of
hardware rings to be used for each such instance. User processes can ask
the kernel driver to map these rings into their address spaces. To
access a given device (identified by the number in the filenames below),
the user must be granted read/write access to the following files, which
may be in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev</span></code>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uio&lt;0..N&gt;</span></code> (where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;0..N&gt;</span></code> are the qat uio device numbers)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qat*</span></code></p></li>

<span id="security-ia-driver"></span><h4>Intentional Modification of IA Driver<a class="headerlink" href="#intentional-modification-of-ia-driver" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Threat</strong>: An attacker can potentially modify the IA driver to behave
maliciously. This may lead to a denial of service of Intel<sup>®</sup>
Quick Assist Technology services.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: The driver object/executable file on disk should be
protected using the normal file protection mechanisms so that it is
writable only by trusted users, for example, a privileged user or an
administrator. Specifically, the Intel<sup>®</sup> QuickAssist Technology
kernel objects and libraries should not be writeable by user. If the
<em>qat</em> user group is being used to provide access to Intel<sup>®</sup>
Quick Assist Technology services, then this group should not have write
permission to the binaries.</p>
</section>
<section id="modification-of-the-qat-configuration-file">
<span id="security-conf-file"></span><h4>Modification of the QAT Configuration File<a class="headerlink" href="#modification-of-the-qat-configuration-file" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Threat</strong>: The QAT configuration file is read at initialization time by
the driver and specifies what instances of each service (cryptographic,
data compression) should be created, and which rings each service
instance will use. Modifying this file could lead to denial of service
by deleting required instances or could be used to attempt to create
additional instances that the attacker could subsequently attempt to
access for malicious purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: The configuration file should be protected using the
normal file protection mechanisms so that it is writable only by trusted
users, for example, a privileged user or an administrator.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>By default, the configuration file is stored in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc</span></code> directory and may be named something like, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c6xxx_dev0.conf</span></code> . Its default permissions are that it is readable and writeable only by <em>root</em> user and <em>qat</em> group.</p>

</section>
<section id="malicious-application-code">
<span id="security-app-code"></span><h4>Malicious Application Code<a class="headerlink" href="#malicious-application-code" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Threat</strong>: An attacker who can gain access to the Intel<sup>®</sup>
QuickAssist Technology API may be able to exploit the following features
of the API:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Buffers passed to the API have a specified length of up to 32 bits.
By specifying excessive lengths, an attacker may be able to cause
denial of service by overwriting data beyond the end of a buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffer lists passed to the API consist of a scatter gather list
(array of buffers). An attacker may incorrectly specify the number of
buffers, causing denial of service due to the reading or writing of
incorrect buffers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Platform management can include the Rate Limiting
feature to mitigate against Noisy Neighbors. Only trusted users and
applications should be allowed to access the Intel<sup>®</sup> QuickAssist
Technology API, as described in General Mitigations.</p>
</section>
<section id="denial-of-service">
<span id="security-denial-of-service"></span><h4>Denial of Service<a class="headerlink" href="#denial-of-service" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Threat</strong>: An attacker may construct a service request that does not
conform to the specification, resulting in low of service due to service
timeouts, halting of Quick Assist service or undesired platform level
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: The current generation of Intel<sup>®</sup> Quick Assist
Technology has been designed for performance, providing direct access to
hardware via PCIe* MMIO space. Misuse of hardware registers is to be
avoided, and the threat against intentional misuse must be mitigated by
ensuring all software on the platform is trusted.</p>
<p>An attacker may attempt to contrive a packet stream that monopolizes the
acceleration services, thereby denying service to legitimate users. This
may consist of one or more of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sending packets that are compressed (for example, using IPComp) or
encrypted (for example, using IPsec), thereby reducing the
availability of these services to legitimate traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending excessively large packets, causing some latency for
legitimate packets.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending small packets at a high packet rate, causing extra bandwidth
utilization on the PCI Express* bus connecting the device to the
processor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Proper monitoring of Device Usage (DU) and the
construction of Service Level Agreements (SLA) are now available as part
of the Rate Limiting feature.</p>

<section id="threats-specific-to-cryptographic-service">
<h3>Threats Specific to Cryptographic Service<a class="headerlink" href="#threats-specific-to-cryptographic-service" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Threats against the cryptographic service include:</p>
<section id="reading-cryptographic-keys">
<h4>Reading Cryptographic Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-cryptographic-keys" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Threat</strong>: Cryptographic keys are stored in DRAM. An attacker who can determine where these are stored could read the DRAM to get access to the keys or could write the DRAM to use keys known by the attacker, thereby compromising the confidentiality of data protected by these keys. Some cryptographic keys have long lives. The impact of an attacker obtaining the key may exist for the lifetime of the key itself.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: DRAM is considered inside the cryptographic boundary (as defined by FIPS 140-2). The normal memory protection schemes provided by the Intel<sup>®</sup> architecture processor and memory controller, and by the operating system, prevent unauthorized access to these memory regions.</p>
